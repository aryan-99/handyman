# Handyman
### Aryan Mittal (aryan-99)

**Handyman** is a mobile application built to connect users to handymen (electricians, plumbers, painters, etc.) for either short notice work orders, or long term projects. Maintenance can be a tough task at times, as can home renovation projects - sometimes, it's just simpler to let the experts handle it. Based on their location, users will be able to view handymen around them for their specific requirements and will be able to directly contact them through the application. Dependent on the nature of the request and the time frame, a handyman will be dispatched by the company selected. While this is limited to residential areas only (for this scope), this can be scaled to include commercial properties as well. Ideally, the application would also have a payment gateway, but will be avoided for this scope as well.

This application will be built using React Native - other tools/frameworks are to be decided.
